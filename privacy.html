        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>The coalition of organizations behind ShutTheBackDoor.net takes your privacy seriously. Among our fundemental principles:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We do not sell our email list. We do not share or distribute your contact information unless specifically stated so.</li>
        <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
        <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except when absolutely necessary for the functionality of the site, to comply with the law, or protect our rights.</li>
        <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for a specific organizational effort, such as delivering a message to congress or in order to communicate with you about an upcoming effort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>Like most websites, ShutTheBackDoor.net collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ShutTheBackDoor.net’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ShutTheBackDoor.net’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ShutTheBackDoor.net may share non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate with organizations and employees of organizations that are members of the coalition, e.g., for example the number of visitors or signups during a particular period.</p>
        <p>ShutTheBackDoor.net also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users who sign up for events or register to join the coalition in an organized action.
